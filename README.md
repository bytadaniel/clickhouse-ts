## TS client for clickhouse database with using in-memory caching rows for bulk insertion

### üíô Typescript
This package is written in TypeScript because Node.js typing development is already an industry standard.
### üñê Bulk insert
It has been empirically verified that in-memory collecting rows is the most efficient and consistent way to insert into Clickhouse. To work with built-in caching, you just need to call the useCaching() method
### üí™ Transparent and Stability
clickhouse-ts doesn't use a lot of abstractions and dependencies, so it's fast and stable.
### üèó Ready for production
The Lookforsale team has been using clickhouse-ts effectively for over a year under extreme loads!
### üëç Batch validation
Double checking data for anomalies during in-memory caching and when inserting a finished batch.
### ‚ú® Flexibility
Flexible configuration of the Clickhouse client instance and support for all features provided by Clickhouse developers.
### üîê Security
SQL Injection Protection with sqlstring
### üåà Free for use
The package has a public license and is available for download to any developer!
